# Word Embedding Analysis

This project goes into the analysis of word embeddings created from IMDB movie reviews. The entire workflow spans from initial data cleaning to interactive visualization, capturing insights into how words relate within the movie review context.

## Overview
1. **Data:** IMDB movie reviews `imbd_movie_reviews.csv`, which is accessible here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?select=IMDB+Dataset.csv
2. **Processing:** Text cleaning and tokenization.
3. **Modeling:** Utilizing Word2Vec for generating word embeddings.
4. **Analysis:** Evaluating cosine similarities and 2 approaches to k-nearest neighbors.
5. **Visualization:** Interactive PCA visualization for getting insights into word embeddings. They can be looked at in the `results` folder.

To get started, get the data and execute the script `word_embedding_analysis.ipynb`. The PCA plot offers an interactive feature to add words for analysis.

Have fun!
